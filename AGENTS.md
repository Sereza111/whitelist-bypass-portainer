# Persistent project context

Before changing the transport, read:

1. `docs/PROTOCOL_ARCHITECTURE.md`
2. `docs/PERFORMANCE_ROADMAP.md`
3. `docs/TARGET_ARCHITECTURE.md`
4. `docs/PRODUCT_ROADMAP.md`
5. upstream source at commit `64aa77acd5b52c34f5ddbd1ad0d861ea65bc8943`

## Current objective

Turn the experimental whitelist-bypass tunnel into a measurable, stable
server/client system. The current deployment uses the direct VK creator in
Portainer and a headless Joiner in Video mode.

## Non-negotiable rules

- Never commit cookies, access tokens, call links, server credentials, IPs, or
  generated `.env` files.
- Server and Joiner protocol changes must ship together or be protected by a
  capability/version handshake. Do not silently break v0.3.7 clients.
- Reproduce and measure before tuning. Record mode, client commit, FPS, batch,
  dual-track state, TUN/SOCKS mode, throughput, loss, RTT, CPU, and failures.
- Do not add generic compression or VLESS solely on intuition. Most payload is
  already encrypted TLS data, and the project already has a connection mux.
- Prefer small reversible changes with an explicit compatibility path.

## Most important current findings

- VK Video, Telemost Video, and Dion Video send relay frames over VP8 without a
  reliability layer. A lost/reordered RTP frame can lose TCP bytes.
- Only WB Stream Video is wrapped in `KCPTunnel` in the baseline branch.
- The existing mux is `connID + message type`; it has no per-stream flow control
  or fair scheduler. Blocking writes can stall unrelated connections.
- Default VP8 pacing has a theoretical ceiling near 6.5 Mbps before overhead,
  retransmits, SFU loss, and CPU costs.
- Matching Windows Joiner source and CI now live in `joiner-desktop-app/` and
  `.github/workflows/windows-joiner.yml`.
- `MsgHello/MsgHelloAck` capability negotiation and periodic transport metrics
  are implemented. Unanswered handshakes fall back to legacy mode.
- `headless/manager` and `portainer-stack-panel.yml` provide an authenticated
  multi-session panel. Profiles persist in atomic JSON, every session has an
  isolated Creator subprocess, link/log/metrics directory, and global plus
  per-client limits. SQLite history/vault/SSE work is still pending.
- `portainer-stack.yml` is now the recommended single deployment containing
  the panel and Creator supervisor. The VK community bot moved to
  `portainer-stack-bot.yml`; direct/panel stacks must not run together.
- Adaptive KCP defaults to the balanced profile: bounded non-blocking output
  queue, WaitSnd backpressure, 1024 window and congestion control. Stable uses
  256 and fast 2048. A silent-stall detector requests carrier recovery;
  METRICS reports kbps, output queue, drops, backpressure and recoveries.

## Next implementation order

1. Verify matching Windows artifact and server image CI from the same commit.
2. Add a repeatable SOCKS-only benchmark and capture baseline metrics.
3. Prototype negotiated reliable Video for VK and align KCP MTU/read sizes.
4. Compare raw versus KCP Video under controlled loss.
5. Measure balanced/stable/fast under loss, then add per-connection queues,
   flow control and fair scheduling.
6. Extract the existing VK bot process supervisor into `wlb-manager` only after
   transport compatibility and metrics are in place.
